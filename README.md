## Generating Data with noise, Plotting Single file data with best fit curves and Multiple Text File Handling
### Objective:

- Generating Data with noise.
- Plottng single file data with best fit curves.
- Multiple File Handling.
### Conclusion
- 1.We have learned how to the handle file in python
- i. Generating data with noise
- ii. Gaussian Curve fit
- iii. Plotting Single file data
- iv. Multiple file Handling
- A curve or mathematical function that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints.
- An optimal set of parameters for a defined function that best fits a given set of observations.
- We had imported scipy.optimized to fit our data. We can learn more about curve_fit by using the help function within scipy online documentation.
- The curve_fit function has two required inputs: the function you want to fit, the x-data, and the y-data you fit.
- We use ("for loop") for mutiple file handling
- We used ("for loop") for sorting and arranging data in order and avoid scatterness of the plot.
- Adding titles and lables to plot the graph in python by using different colors.

# Mini Project 02
## Plotting United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time with best fit curves.
### Objective:
- EDA
- Curve fitting
### Conclusion:
- Applying an random exponential distribution fit to a histogram.
- We have learned how to fit postioned centre of the bins. Graph is plotted with align on the edges with color. Also we had learned how to fit best curves.
- We used pandas for biuld uping the Data Frame. We used arrays for total no. of cases.
- We used fitting function and plotting.

# Mini Project 03
## Exploring the Data Sets of Hotel bookings
### Objectives:
- Understanding concepts of exploratory data analysis.
-  Commands required for exploratory data analysis

### Conclusion:
- We learned how to explore data sets.
- We had sorted null values from country, agent and company.
- Among these 2 categories "City Hotel" have more booking than "Resort Hotel" throughout the year.
- More values of hotel bookings are from City Hotel-79330 and Resort Hotel-40060
- On average Customer mainly prefers "Resort Hotel" for weekend night stays than "City Hotel".
- During weekdays also on average customer prefers "Resort Hotel" than "City Hotel" for night stays.

# Mini Project 04
# Titanic Survivors Data Exploration and Visualization
### Objective:
- Understanding concepts of exploratory data analysis.
- Tools and commands required for exploratory data analysis.

### Conclusion:
- Titanic survivals: We had sorted null values from this data Age, cabin and Embarked.
- We had plotted the bar graph in that females had survived more than male.
- More passenger survived who were travelling alone than those travelling with friends or family.
- In titanic the count of male is more and females are less.
- We had sorted the alone persons are more than Families. Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton are embarked and survived more in Titanic.
- Maximum passengers who survived are 1st Class females while the least are 3rd class males.
