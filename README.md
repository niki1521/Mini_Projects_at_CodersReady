## Generating Data with noise, Plotting Single file data with best fit curves and Multiple Text File Handling
### Objective:

- Generating Data with noise.
- Plottng single file data with best fit curves.
- Multiple File Handling.
### Conclusion
- 1.We have learned how to the handle file in python
- i. Generating data with noise
- ii. Gaussian Curve fit
- iii. Plotting Single file data
- iv. Multiple file Handling
- A curve or mathematical function that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints.
- An optimal set of parameters for a defined function that best fits a given set of observations.
- We had imported scipy.optimized to fit our data. We can learn more about curve_fit by using the help function within scipy online documentation.
- The curve_fit function has two required inputs: the function you want to fit, the x-data, and the y-data you fit.
- We use ("for loop") for mutiple file handling
- We used ("for loop") for sorting and arranging data in order and avoid scatterness of the plot.
- Adding titles and lables to plot the graph in python by using different colors.
